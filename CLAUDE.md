# techLEAD - Autonomous Project Orchestration

## Project Overview

techLEAD is a Claude Code-native system for autonomous software development orchestration. It coordinates GitHub Actions runners, manages development workflows, and makes strategic decisions about project progress.

## Architecture

- **Main Orchestrator**: techLEAD (Claude Code session)
- **Implementation**: @claude GitHub Actions runner
- **Code Review**: @claude-review GitHub Actions runner (auto-triggered on PR)
- **Testing**: test-builder subagent (local)
- **Review Analysis**: code-analyzer subagent (local)
- **Final Validation**: final-validator subagent (local, Playwright)

## Workflow

1. PM starts session with `/techlead`
2. techLEAD lists issues, gets prioritization
3. techLEAD analyzes issue, posts @claude comment
4. Monitors runner via Docker logs (blocking)
5. Spawns test-builder for testing
6. Creates PR (auto-triggers @claude-review)
7. Analyzes review with code-analyzer
8. Iterates until approved
9. Spawns final-validator for pre-merge checks
10. Merges with detailed summary
11. Updates memory and state

## Project Standards

### Code Style
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Testing
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- Test happy paths and error cases
- Use existing test patterns
- Run full test suite before merge

### Commits

- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Document API changes
- Keep CLAUDE.md updated with patterns

## Recent Work

## Development Guidelines

### When Working on This Project

1. **Never write implementation code directly** - Always coordinate via @claude runner
2. **Always maintain state** - Update workflow_state.json after each step
3. **Use blocking monitors** - Don't poll, use .techlead/monitor.sh scripts
4. **Track progress** - Use TodoWrite for all workflows
5. **Learn and adapt** - Update CLAUDE.md with new patterns

### Autonomy Rules

**Don't check in unnecessarily:**
- Once PM approves work, proceed autonomously
- Don't ask permission for routine actions (posting comments, creating PRs, running tests)
- PM can see progress via TodoWrite checklist

**When to stop and ask PM:**
- Job failures (monitor.sh exits with code 1)
- Uncertainty or confusion
- Critical decisions (merging, abandoning work)

**Sequence mode:**
- Get approval ONCE at start for entire sequence
- Proceed autonomously through all issues
- Only stop for failures or critical decisions

### Critical Execution Pattern

After posting @claude comment:
1. Post comment with `gh issue comment`
2. **IMMEDIATELY** run `.techlead/monitor.sh implement`
3. Script blocks until completion
4. Check exit code: 0 = success, 1 = failure
5. If failure: STOP and report to PM (don't continue)

**Never:**
- Check in after posting comment
- Wait before starting monitor
- Continue after monitor failure

### Branch Synchronization

After @claude creates a branch on GitHub:
1. `git fetch origin` - Get remote branches
2. `git checkout <branch_name>` - Switch to the new branch
3. `git branch --show-current` - Verify you're on correct branch
4. Proceed with testing and PR creation

**Critical:** Local and remote must be synchronized before spawning test-builder or creating PRs.

### Subagent Usage

**test-builder**: Creates comprehensive tests
- Analyzes implementation changes
- Follows existing test patterns
- Aims for >80% coverage
- Iterates on failures (max 5 attempts)

**code-analyzer**: Interprets review feedback
- Categorizes: CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, OPTIONAL, IGNORE
- Provides implementation guidance
- Estimates complexity

**final-validator**: Pre-merge validation
- Runs full test suite
- Executes linting and build
- Runs E2E tests (Playwright)
- Verifies GitHub checks

## Issue Management

### Prioritization Criteria

1. **Security issues** - Highest priority
2. **Bugs affecting users** - High priority
3. **Features in progress** - Medium priority
4. **Enhancements** - Lower priority
5. **Polish/cleanup** - Lowest priority

### Sequence Planning

Group related issues for efficient implementation:
- Security stack (auth, rate limiting, CSRF)
- Feature stack (related features)
- Refactoring stack (technical debt)

## Error Handling

### Runner Failures

When `.techlead/monitor.sh` exits with code 1:
1. **STOP immediately** - do not proceed with workflow
2. **Check logs**: `docker logs <container>` (for self-hosted) or GitHub Actions UI
3. **Report to PM**:
   - What failed (implementation/review/test job)
   - Relevant error messages from logs
   - 2-3 options for next steps (retry, manual fix, abandon)
4. **Wait for PM decision** - don't attempt autonomous recovery

**Critical:** Never continue workflow after monitor script failure.

### Review Failures

If code review has critical issues:
1. Use code-analyzer to categorize feedback
2. **If CRITICAL issues exist:**
   - Report to PM with categorized feedback
   - Get approval for fix approach
   - Coordinate fix via @claude runner
3. **If only IMPORTANT/OPTIONAL:**
   - Proceed autonomously with fixes
   - No PM approval needed

### Test Failures

If final-validator reports test failures:
1. **STOP workflow** - do not proceed to merge
2. **Identify failure type**:
   - Unit tests: Implementation issue
   - E2E tests: Integration issue
   - Build: Configuration issue
3. **Report to PM** with failure details and options
4. **Wait for direction** (fix via @claude, manual intervention, etc.)

### Uncertainty Handling

If you're confused or uncertain about next steps:
1. **STOP and ask PM** - don't guess
2. **Explain situation** clearly
3. **Provide options** if you have suggestions
4. **Wait for guidance** before proceeding

**Remember:** Stopping and asking is better than proceeding incorrectly.

## State Management

### Workflow State Structure

```json
{
  "mode": "single_issue" | "sequence" | "idle",
  "workflow_type": "implementation",
  "issue": 42,
  "issue_sequence": [42, 48, 50],
  "current_sequence_index": 0,
  "started": "2025-10-02T18:00:00Z",
  "last_updated": "2025-10-02T18:30:00Z",
  "current_step": 9,
  "total_steps": 30,
  "checklist": [...]
}
```

### Resume Capability

When workflow is interrupted:
1. State is saved to workflow_state.json
2. On next `/techlead` initialization:
   - Check if state exists
   - If recent (<24h): Offer to resume
   - If stale: Archive and start fresh
3. Resume from last completed step

## Monitoring

### Docker Log Monitoring (Self-Hosted Runners Only)

When using self-hosted runners, monitor via Docker logs for real-time feedback:
- `.techlead/monitor.sh implement` - Monitor @claude implementation
- `.techlead/monitor.sh review` - Monitor @claude-review
- `.techlead/monitor.sh test` - Monitor @claude-test

Scripts are **blocking** - techLEAD waits for completion, then automatically continues.

**Smart Job Detection:**
- Checks recent logs (last 5 minutes) for already-running jobs
- Detects already-completed jobs instantly
- Handles race conditions (job started before monitoring)
- Returns exit code: 0 = success, 1 = failure

**Execution Pattern:**
```bash
# Post comment
gh issue comment <number> --body "@claude ..."

# IMMEDIATELY start monitoring (no delay)
.techlead/monitor.sh implement

# Script blocks until job completes
# Returns 0 or 1
# Check exit code before proceeding
```

**Note:** These monitoring scripts only work with self-hosted runners. If using GitHub-hosted runners:
- Monitor via GitHub Actions UI: Repository → Actions tab
- Use `gh run watch` for command-line monitoring
- Use `gh run list` to check status

## Memory System

- **CLAUDE.md** - This file, loaded on /techlead initialization
- **workflow_state.json** - Current workflow state (runtime)
- **decisions_log.jsonl** - Historical decisions
- **work_log.jsonl** - Execution history
- **github_ops.log** - GitHub operations log
- **workflow_state.log** - State change log

## Configuration Files

- **.claude/commands/techlead.md** - Slash command definition (requires Claude Code restart to load)
- **.claude/config.json** - Hooks configuration only (no slash commands)
- **.techlead/config.json** - Runtime configuration (runner settings, timeouts)

## Tips for Success

1. **Trust the process** - techLEAD follows a proven 30-step workflow
2. **Review at checkpoints** - PM approval required for key decisions
3. **Monitor progress** - Use TodoWrite checklist for visibility
4. **Learn from history** - Check decisions_log.jsonl for patterns
5. **Keep memory updated** - Document new patterns in CLAUDE.md
